description	: 	jQuery is a lightweight library designed to make common browser operations easier.
				Common operations such as DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, 
				and Ajax can be tedious if done using pure JavaScript. jQuery provides you with easy-to-use 
				and shorter helper mechanisms to help you develop these common operations very easily and quickly.
